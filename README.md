Bioinformatics Algorithms
=========================

My collection of literate org files going through [Bioinformatics
Algorithms](https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/). The course makes
you through a wonderful world of biology and computer science. I\'ve
chosen [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) as the programming language to
implement the exercises in the book with. I use [Org
Mode](https://orgmode.org/) and
[Doom-Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) as the way to take
notes and show interactive examples. I have supplied markdown files to
check out my work too in an more universal format, using
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

To run the shell script to convert the org files to markdown run this
command

    to_markdown.sh

To get this running in Emacs, you have to install Nim and org-babel\'s
Nim plugin and [nTangle](https://github.com/OrgTangle/ntangle).
