# Bioinformatics Algorithms


My collection of literate org files going through [Bioinformatics
Algorithms](https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/). The course makes
you through a wonderful world of biology and computer science. I\'ve
chosen [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) as the programming language to
implement the exercises in the book with. ~~I use [Org
Mode](https://orgmode.org/) and
[Doom-Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) as the way to take
notes and show interactive examples. I have supplied markdown files to
check out my work too in an more universal format, using
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).~~

I am continueing with Markdown, Doom Emacs is awesome and I would recommend everyone to check it out, it just works and you can get everything you want. But at a certain point I have spent more time messing around with OrgMode than actual learning, I do not need the fancy stuff supplied by org and `markdown + git` is more than enough for my needs!
